This Comet User Agreement ("Terms") applies to your access to and use of getcomet.net ("Comet," "we," or "us"). By accessing or using Comet, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use Comet.

## Age
You must be 13 years of age or older to access and use Comet.

## Your Account
To use certain features of Comet, you may be required to create a Comet account (an "Account") and provide us with a username and password. By creating an account, you agree to these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

You are solely responsible for the information associated with Your Account and anything that happens related to Your Account. Your account security is Your responsibility and Comet is not liable for any Account security issues. We recommend that you use a strong password that is used only with Comet.

You will not license, sell, or transfer your Account without our prior written approval.

## Your Content
Comet may contain information, text, links, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials (“Content”), including Content created with or submitted to Comet by you or through your Account (“Your Content”). We take no responsibility for and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse any of Your Content.

By submitting Your Content to Comet, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power, and authority necessary to grant the rights to Your Content contained within these Terms. Because you alone are responsible for Your Content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share Content without all necessary rights.

You retain any ownership rights you have in Your Content, but you grant Comet the following license to use that Content:

When Your Content is created with or submitted to Comet, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display Your Content and any name, username, voice, or likeness provided in connection with Your Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed. This license includes the right for us to make Your Content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication by other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Comet. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with Your Content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content.

Any ideas, suggestions, and feedback about Comet that you provide to us are entirely voluntary, and you agree that Comet may use such ideas, suggestions, and feedback without compensation or obligation to you.

Although we have no obligation to screen, edit, or monitor Your Content, we may, in our sole discretion, delete or remove Your Content at any time and for any reason, including for a violation of these Terms, a violation of our Content Policy, or if you otherwise create liability for us.

## Third-Party Content
Comet may contain links to third-party websites, products, or services, which may be posted by other users (“Third-Party Content”). Third-Party Content is not under our control, and we are not responsible for any of their websites, products, or services. Your use of Third-Party Content is at your own risk and you should make any investigation you feel necessary before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Content.
